Jan 21. Lab Exercise  Due Jan 28, 2014

The Lucas sequence is defined as 
L1 = 1; L2 = 3; and 
L(k+1) = L(k) + L(k-1) for k>2

Write an assembly language program to list the first 
50 terms in both Hex and Decimal:

1 00000001  1
2 00000003  3
3 00000004  4
4 00000007  7
...
50 ..........  ..........

Requirements:

Use ecx as the loop counter and the LOOP instruction
Use WriteDec to display the sequence number 1,2,3...
Use WriteHex and WriteDec to display the Lucas number.

Use screen capture to make a file copy of your output.
Hand in copies of your source file and the output.

Something should go wrong. Don't worry, you'll fix it
in the next assignment:  

Modify your assembly language program
to list the 1st to 150th Lucas numbers in Hex only

After that:

Modify your assembly language program
to list the 1st to 150th Lucas numbers in 
both Hex and Decimal
